# Crop-and-Fertilizer-recommendation-system-using-ML
The Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System was enhanced with several key improvisations to improve its accuracy, usability, and practical impact. For crop recommendations, real-time weather integration, yield prediction. In fertilizer recommendations, advanced features like nutrient deficiency diagnosis, pest and disease management.

# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System ðŸŒ±

A machine learning-based system that recommends the most suitable crops and fertilizers based on soil and environmental conditions. This project helps farmers optimize their resources, improve productivity, and practice sustainable agriculture.
